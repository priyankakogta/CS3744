Write a desktop GUI application HW1 using JavaFX based on the following requirements:

- The initial size of the application window is 400 (width) by 500 (height).
- The goal is to implement a color chooser where the color is specified as a combination of red, green and blue components:
     - Each component is specified as percentage value (0%-100%)  of the maximum intensity.

- Color rectangle (label) uses 70% of the height of the window.
- Each slider uses 10% height and 50% width.
- The labels on each side of a slider are of equal length.
- Spacing around/between components is 10 pixels.
- Initial values for red, green, and blue colors is 0 (black).
   - The color is displayed in the color rectangle in the upper section of the application window.
   - The sliders' values (percentages) are displayed using two decimal digits and the corresponding text color.
